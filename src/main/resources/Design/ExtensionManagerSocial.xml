= Social API =

Add social APIs to the repository API. For repositories supporting it obviously.

It can more or less be defined as anything not in the Extension java class. Since all theses can change anytime on server it's never downloaded/stored with the extension description but instead requested to the repository only when displaying them. That give several choices for them: would be either directly requested to the repository in ajax or pass though the wiki server.

== Authenticate to repository ==

* have a user to deal with the repository for all social features
* allow the repository to filter extensions
** allowed extensions
** payed extensions, etc.

== Grades ==

Give grades to extensions

== Comments ==

Add comments associated to extensions

== Share extensions ==</content>
