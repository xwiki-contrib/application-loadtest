= Free form description of the extension =

Should definitely be more than a plain text but there is several choices for the storing format. Comments associated to extensions also have the same concern.

== Any provided syntax ==

* pros
** wiki way
** allow to do well integrated and nicer description more easily
** works whatever the client used to displays it (as long as it as an implementation of XWiki Rendering). i.e. does not have to be a browser.

* cons
** less safe. But a white list of macro should probably do it, definitely not allow script macros.
** slower display of the extension description. But not that expensive either since it's not going to be scripts anyway.
** same than when choosing the font in a browser: it's possible the client does not support the syntax used (client with older version of XWiki etc...).

== Server side rendered XHTML output ==

* pros
** safer for the client since there is no transformation (cannot exploit a bug in some macro)

* cons
** only work with XWiki Extension Repository
** content bigger and so more things to transfer in client/server communication
