Extension Manager already exist, you can see documentation about its current state on [[extensions:Extension.Extension Module]].

This page is about future features and improvements of Extension Manager.

= UI =

[[ExtensionManagerUI]]

= Upgrade Farm In 5 Minutes =

[[ExtensionManagerUpgradeFarmIn5Minutes]]

= Installed extensions =

[[ExtensionManagerInstalledExtensions]]

= Return back information to the server =

The idea is to give some information to the server when it support it:

* extension has been installed succesfully
* extension installing failed
* extension has been uninstalled
* ...

= Virtual extensions as dependency =

Virtual extension are already implemented but one thing is missing: put virtual extension as dependency.

== pom.xml extension ==

Define how to indicate a dependency that maven will obviously be unable to find itself.

== Find the extension ==

Also need a way to find an extension by one of its supported features. Easy to add this in XWiki repository but not so much in maven repository where we can't easily search.

= Extension index =

[[ExtensionManagerIndexer]]

= Advanced repository search API =

[[ExtensionManagerSearch]]

= Repositories =

[[ExtensionManagerRepositories]]

= Install an extension not coming from a repository =

{{todo/}}

= New XWiki packaging format =

[[ExtensionManageXWikiPackage]]

= Social =

[[ExtensionManagerSocial]]

= Misc =

* add possibility to reinstall an extension (to restore it when a page has been removed by mistake or something like that)
* internationalize extension manager

= Ideas (less obviously useful) =

* add enable/disable extension support ([[XWIKI-5704&gt;&gt;http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-5704]])

= Links and things to look at =

* [[Debian Policy Manual&gt;&gt;http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/]] and especially [[Declaring relationships between packages&gt;&gt;http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html]] for inspiration
* [[Aether&gt;&gt;https://docs.sonatype.org/display/AETHER/Home]]: official maven atifact resolving and dedpendency management library
* [[Apache Ivy&gt;&gt;http://groovy.codehaus.org/Grapes+and+grab%28%29]]: looks like [[groovy is using that as a library&gt;&gt;http://groovy.codehaus.org/Grapes+and+grab%28%29]] so could we (even if i could not find any reference to that on the Ivy website). It also supports maven so it could also be an alternative to Aether
* OSGi
* http://blog.caucho.com/tag/pomegranate/ (see also the comments at http://blog.caucho.com/?p=211)
* [[Apache ACE&gt;&gt;http://incubator.apache.org/ace/]]
* [[Commet&gt;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_%28programming%29]] to be used for question/answer UI</content>
